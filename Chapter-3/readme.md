# Triangular and Trapezoidal Curves for the Car Control Problem
## This code implements the Car Control Problem with three linguistic variables: Distance, Speed, and Acceleration. Figure 1 shows linguistic variable Distance, Figure 2 shows linguistic variable Speed, and Figure 3 shows linguistic variable Acceleration. Therefore, you can download the five files (ex., car_problem_acceleration.h, car_problem_distance.h, car_problem_speed.h, main2.cc, and MAX_MIN.h) and place them in a folder to use this code. After that, compile the `main.cc` file (e.g., `g++ main2.cc -o main2`) and run it, for example, `./main_1`.
### In Linux systems, you need the following libraries: `build-essential, autoconf, automake, libxmu-dev, xorg-dev, gcc, and g++`. Therefore, in Windows Systems, you need to install Dev-C++.

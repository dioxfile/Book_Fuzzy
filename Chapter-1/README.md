## This code implements the IPP linguistic variable space with three fuzzy functions (e.g., low, medium, and high). Thus, to use this code, download the three files and place them in a folder. After that, compile the `main.cc` (e.g., `g++ main.cc -o main`) file and run it, for example, `./main`.
### In Linux systems, you need the following libraries: `build-essential, autoconf, automake, libxmu-dev, xorg-dev, gcc, and g++`. Therefore, in Windows Systems, you need to install Dev-C++.

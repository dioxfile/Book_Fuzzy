## This code implements the IPP linguistic variable space with three fuzzy functions (e.g., low, medium, and high), Figure 1. So, to use this code, you can just download the three files and place them in a folder. After that, compile the `main.cc` file (e.g., `g++ main.cc -o main`) and run it, for example, `./main`.
### In Linux systems, you need the following libraries: `build-essential, autoconf, automake, libxmu-dev, xorg-dev, gcc, and g++`. Therefore, in Windows Systems, you need to install Dev-C++.
